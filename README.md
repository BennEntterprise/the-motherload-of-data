# The-Motherload-of-Data

This project is inspired by the film "The Social Dilemma". I find it alarming
that are algorithms that take in our data and we really have no way to grok
how our data is being used.

And so this repository was born...

# The Goal

My goal is that this project eventually evolves into a way for the layperson to
visualize, interact with , and understand the digital landscape, and their
footprint within that landscape.

Above all, this repository of data should be open to the public, with the intent
that prevailing social trend will persuade this tool to be integrated into all
devices that interface with a network on behalf of a user.

# The (tentative) plan

1.  Come up with some terminologies, define the landscape.
2.  ?
3.  ?

## Some Potential Things we can do/build.

- Create a survey of "what services do you use". We can then show the user types
  of data points that are collected from that particular set of services.
- A visualization that shows "families" of data points; data points that are related
  to each other but will have their own distinct measurement.
- Interactive word clouds?
- A 'self' audit tool?
